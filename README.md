# 📕 KnowledgeEngine

A calm, offline-first space to actually study.  
No ads. No logins. No nonsense.

## What it does

KnowledgeEngine lets students explore their class syllabus one step at a time:

1. Pick your class
2. Choose a subject
3. Dive into topics — with clean notes, quiz questions, and key terms
4. Search across everything (soon with flashcards too)

Everything is structured into folders like `/class8/history/revoltof87`, so it just works.

---

## Why it exists

Because most learning websites feel like marketing traps.

This one doesn’t.
